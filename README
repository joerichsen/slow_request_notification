Slow Request Notification is a Rails plugin that will send email notifications
when a request in your Rails app is slower than say 10 seconds.

The plugin is to be used to catch situations like a lot of users signing up to 
your app, entering lots of data and maybe you forgot to add an index to your
database :-)

The following things are configurable:

* the request time limit that will cause emails to be sent when it is exceeded
* the sender of the emails
* the recepients of the emails
* the subject of the mails

The plugin is very much inspired by Jamis Buck's excellent Exception Notifier
plugin.
